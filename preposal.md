# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A simulation of a three type population evolutionary game theory (EGT) game. There is a package for game theory that does this, but it is just for a two type population simulation. The addition of three is what makes this a challenge. 

I can also try graphing equilibriums of a predator-prey dynamic game of an EGT independent project I am working on. This project is looking at modeling immune cells and cancer cells as a predator-prey game. There are standard predator-prey equations, but with this project there are extra parameters that change with the different types of immune cells. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Don't plan to collaborate. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?
