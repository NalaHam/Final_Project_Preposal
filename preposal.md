# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A simulation of a three type population evolutionary game theory (EGT) game. There is a package for game theory that does something similar (nashpy), but it is just for a two type population simulation. The addition of three is what makes this a challenge. Graphing in python will also be a challenge. 

After having a graphical representation of this type of game, I can then graph the trends of the rate of change of populations frequency. Meaning that if three population types start at 0.2, 0.7, and 0.1, what trends do the population frequency have. If the game has an equilibrium the frequencys will go towards this equilibirum frequencies. This can be done through the package called egtplot. It's documentation is here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/300004v2.full.pdf
